title: "Jean Racine | Wikiwand"
description: "Jean-Baptiste Racine  was a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France, along with Molière and Corneille as well as an important literary figure in the Western tradition and world literature. Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such \"examples of neoclassical perfection\"[1] as Phèdre,[2] Andromaque,[3] and Athalie.[4] He did write one comedy, Les Plaideurs,[5] and a muted tragedy,  Esther[6] for the young."
