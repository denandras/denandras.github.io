<em><p>Not long after it appeared, the error code began to enjoy, or endure, its share of lore. In the early 2000s, the idea bubbled up that the 404 came from, well, room 404; that this room housed the web’s first servers, at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland); that World Wide Web inventor Tim ­Berners-Lee had his office there; that he frequently could not be found.
</p>
<p>“Sigh,” wrote Robert Cailliau, a pioneer, with Berners-Lee, of the hypertext structure that led to the web. When asked for comment on the 404 error, he seemed less than thrilled to be approached with what he called “trivia.” Cailliau was adamant that the mythology is hogwash.
</p>
<p>Error codes were a necessity but not a center-stage concern. “When you write code for a new system, you don’t waste too much time writing long messages for the situations in which you detect an error,” Cailliau wrote in an email to me. Memory was, at the time, also an issue; longer messages were impractical. (“Modern geeks have no longer any idea what it was like to program with 64k of memory,” he wrote.)
</p>
<p>The solution was straightforward: designate numerical ranges for error categories. This was done, in Cailliau’s telling, “according to the whims of the programmer.” Client errors fell into the 400 range, making “404” a relatively arbitrary assignation for “not found.” Cailliau was adamant: “404 was never linked to any room or any physical place at CERN,” he wrote. “That’s a complete myth.”
